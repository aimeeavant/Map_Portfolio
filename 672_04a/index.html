		<h2>Calculating density measures on the fly</h2>

		<p>This lab uses JavaScript functions to accept user input and calculate population density measures
			for three cities in two different units. City information is stored as arrays and iterated

			b. Calculate the population density using the population and area values before returning the result to the caller (i.e., this value will be assigned to the density variable within the mapCities function). Your code within these conditional (if/else) statement bodies will need to mathematically convert the miles to kilometers if the value of units is changed to be 'km'.

		/* 6. Once you have the density value available to you within the mapCities() function loop, you can then build up the markers and popups in a similar fashion as in Lab 03.

The coordinates will be used to place each marker in its correct position. */

		// issue 1: refine how handles bad user input
			// have else if that sets to miles, revise to prompt again, this prompted three times because of location
			// finally figured out the do while negative confusion 

		// issue 2: does not run again if click button
		// runs again and replaces the existing popups with new ones, not sure why this changed

		// isssue 3: pop up not visible because out of frame, odd that the map moves and the popup is in the frame on second click after after another city has been clicked but not first or unless another is clicked
			// bandaid fixed by adjusting map center
